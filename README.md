# Drinking Water Quality Analysis in Germany

## Project Overview
This project aims to assess the water quality in Germany and compare it with global standards. The dataset used in this analysis contains drinking water quality data, and we explore the reasons behind abnormalities in the data. The project is implemented using Python in Jupyter Lab, leveraging popular data analytics libraries such as `pandas`, `seaborn`, and `matplotlib`.

## Dataset Information
The dataset contains information on drinking water quality in Germany and includes a total of 138,521 rows and 16 columns. It contains measurements of various water quality parameters collected from different locations in Germany.
